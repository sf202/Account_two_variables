# Account_two_variables
Modify the Account class(Section 3.3) by adding two instance variables containing the customers name and the account number. (Both will be String objects). Modify the
primary constructor for the Account class so that it takes three parameters: the balance, the customer name and the account number. Add instance methods named
getCustomer Name and getAccountNumber that return the customer name and account number. Modify the TestAccount class so it tests the new constructor and the two
new methods.
